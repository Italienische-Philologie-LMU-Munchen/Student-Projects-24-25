# Student projects in winter semester 2024/25

In this repository you can find the results of the student project work in the Python course for beginners at the Institute of Italian Philology at LMU Munich in the winter semester 2024/25.

Based on the text of a play in TEI XML format (there were several texts to choose from), the students were asked to develop individual analysis ideas and implement them independently using their newly acquired skills in the Python programming language.

The aim was the implementation of meaningful linguistic-literary analyses using Python in a realistic context.

The following students took part in the project work and we would like to thank them for agreeing to the publication of their results: Laura Dürschmied, Julia Ludwig, Nicolai Meußling, Xaver Mittermaier, Johannes Schneider.
